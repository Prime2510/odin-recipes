        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,
             made of very wide, flat sheets.
              Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers
               of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce,
                vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices. </p>
                <h3>ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>meat</li>
                    <li>onion and garlic</li>
                    <li>crushed tomatoes</li>
                    <li>cheese</li>
                    <li>eggs</li>
                    <li>lasagna noodles</li>
                    <li>spices and seasonings</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until “al dente” (not overly cooked). Drain.</li>
                    <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
                    <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly.</li>
                </ol>
